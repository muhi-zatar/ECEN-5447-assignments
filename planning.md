# Project 1 planning phase

The project is to design and implement a Synchronous Machine Model and its controls, you develop a detailed model of a synchronous machine subject including the AVR, Turbine and Governor and subject the system to several perturbations to study its dynamic performance.

The system will be provided by the instructor; a simple 3-bus system.

The project consists of the following components:

- Synchornous Machine Model:
-- Open loop model:
--- A working machine model
-- Closed loop model:
--- The machine model.
--- Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) model
--- Governer model
--- Prime Mover (Turbine)
- The simulation on the system:
-- Model few faults, example:
--- Generator tripping
--- Line faults.
-- Model load perturbations.

Rough plan (02/14/2025):
[] Get familiar with how to load the network using PowerSystems.
